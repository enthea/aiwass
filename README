This directory contains the v. 1.0.0 release of Aiwass.

This is the first release of the source code in any form.

Aiwass was originally written by S. Hill on MS-DOS in Microsoft C 5.0. This
initial snapshot contains the source code as of Dec 21 1993 with minimal
changes, primarily the addition of the GNU GPL licensing notices.

As I no longer have a working MS C 5.0 environent, I am unable to verify that
the code AS-IS will compile. However, it should take minimal effort to get it
working on DOS or Windows from this snapshot. The main issues will be in
regard to the system include files and the location of the configuration
files, which will likely need to be moved into working directory from the
subdirectory 'config'.

This project intends to update to code to run on modern Linux systems. Please
fork the code if you wish to develop and maintain a Windows version.


Documentation
-------------

Aiwass v. 1 did not include any documentation beyond the comments in the
code. Please feel free to contribute documentation to this project.

That said, the first thing one needs to do after getting the code running
is to import the dictionary files (which are located in the 'dictionaries'
directory) and create the lexicon and numicon files. For some reason that
I don't recall, the Hebrew dictionary is broken into 5 files. Once these
dictionaries are imported, the lexicon is stored in the file 'aiwass.lex'.

Aiwass is capable of maintaining multiple numicon files, once the lexicon
is indexed. The numicon files have names in the form <language>.<key>. My
working DOS binaries are using the following numicon files:

    english.brt     English indexed using English Qaballa (british.key)
    english.eng     English indexed using the AREXZ 1496 key (english.key)
    english.grk     English indexed using the Greek key (greek.key)
    english.heb     English indexed using the Hebrew key (hebrew.key)
    greek.grk       Greek indexed using isopsephy (greek.key)
    hebrew.heb      Hebrew indexed using gematria (hebrew.key)

Aiwass includes additional keys for Arabic, Coptic, Enochian, and Latin,
but does not include dictionaries for these languages. These keys can be
used to index the lexicon of any language, though the most common use
will be to create additional numicons for English.

That should be enough information to get started. Good luck!
